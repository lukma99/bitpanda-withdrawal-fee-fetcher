## About this tool
A simple Java Swing Program, which tells you, how much it costs at the moment to withdraw your bitcoin funds from Bitpanda to your hardware-wallet.

The current fee is fetched from here: https://www.bitpanda.com/de/limits

Sadly, the fees are only shown in BTC, and they change regularly. It is not convenient to calculate the current price in EUR everytime you visit the website, when you wait for a cheap fee.
To make things easier, I developed this tool.
